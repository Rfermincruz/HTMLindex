    <title>My thoughts about Bugs Bunny</title>
</head> 
<body>
    <h3>Bugs Bunny its the real MVP</h3>
    <hr/>
    <p>I am not sure if many people would agree, but that is my personal thought.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>According to 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugs_Bunny" target="_blahk">Wikipidia</a>
        "Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray and white rabbit or hare who is famous for his flippant, insouciant personality.<p>

    </p>He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent, his portrayal as a trickster, his signature carrot, and his catch phrase "Eh...What's up, doc?"." </p>
     <h3>In my opinion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>He is funny</li>
        <li>Clever</li>
        <li>One of a Kind</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <h2>Bugs Bunny is royalty</h2>
    <h4>But he is not human</h4>
